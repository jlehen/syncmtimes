Synchronize files mtimes between a source dir and a destination dir.  I had to
do this multiple times so make it public so I can get it when I need it ;-).

Gathering and setting are done by two different processes communicating through
a pipe, so it can work through ssh.

- getmtimes.py takes no arguments.
- setmtimes.py has two options: -n (no exec) and -v (verbose).

The scripts are very basic so just execute them is the right directory.
